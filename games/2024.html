<h1>2024 Game of the Year</h1>
<i>Posted: February 2025</i>
<br><br>

Going to try and get this one out earlier than last year. It's February and I'm actually caught up on my 2024 gaming and starting to play some 2025 releases (like the sequel to my 2022 GOTY, Citizen Sleeper). 


For sheer enjoyment and versatility, I have to hand it to...

<a href=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1147860/UFO_50/><h2>UFO 50</h2></a>

A compilation of 50 retro games, pitched as the collected works of a fictional 80s game studio. A must-buy if you remember gaming in the NES era or earlier, or if you missed that era but are curious to soak in the vibes. These games are all interesting, too. No mere remakes of old games, they range from arcade classics with a twist to retro versions of modern genres like tower defense or deckbuilding. Many of the games are couch-play friendly, too - my boyfriend and I particularly enjoyed Pingolf.

Some of my other favourites: 
<ul>
<li>Magic Garden</li>
<li>Party House</li>
<li>Kick Club</li>
<li>Rock On Island</li>
<li>Bug Hunter</li>
<li>Devilition</li>
<li>Camouflage</li>
<li>Paint Chase (another 2p-friendly game)</li>
</ul>  

<br><br> 

Picking a runner-up is too hard. Sure, I'm tempted to hand it to Balatro (which swallowed many hours of my life early 2024) but that's too easy, isn't it? It's this year's indie darling and the dev behind it is rolling in awards and money now.

<br><br> 

And finally, a retrospective award (a.k.a. a pre-2024 game that I first played in 2024):<br>
<h2>The Case of the Golden Idol (2022)</h2>
I heard some buzz around this when it first came out, but took one look at the art style and tapped out. A sequel, The Rise of the Golden Idol, released in 2024, which prompted me to go back and revisit this one. I'm very glad that I did, because this is exactly the sort of logical puzzle-solving that I looooove.  
<br><br>


<h2>Lightning round:</h2> 
<ul>
<li><a href=https://www.playbalatro.com><b>Balatro</b></a><br>
If you haven't played this one yet, ask yourself whether you really need an addiction in your life. This poker rogue-like encourages experimenting with different strategies and has heavy "just one more run..." vibes. Beware! But also don't miss out on this one. Despite the poker theming, it doesn't have anything to do with gambling and you don't have to like poker (I don't).</li>
<li><b>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</b><br>
<i>A unique take on tower defence.</i> The JRPG-ish art style wasn't my bag when I first saw this, but when I heard it was a tower defence game, I had to check it out - and I'm glad I did because I ended up obsessed with this game for a month. It feels like an old-school (PS3/360 era) game that does one thing well and hasn't overscoped its gameplay. Also, I love any game that lets me collect tasty desserts. Last year, games made me hungry for South Asian food - this year they made me hungry for mochi.</li>
<li><b>Little Kitty, Big City</b><br>
<i>Charming, light, and fun.</i> Certainly the most charming game I played all year. It's light and fun and straightforward, with "Untitled Goose Game" vibes as you explore the city, help its residents, and knock jars off shelves.</li>
<li><b>Tactical Breach Wizards</b><br>
<i>Tactical puzzles with a great sense of humour.</i> Turn-based strategy, but think more chess than XCOM. Each room is a concise puzzle that you try to solve, test your solution, undo if it didn't work, try again. It's quick to complete a few in a row, and the bonus objectives aren't crazy (I often unlock a few on my first run). Special mention to the writing, which I guess is right up my alley because this is one of the few games that actually made me laugh out loud a few times.</li>
<li><b>Indika</b><br>
<i>Weird and philosophical.</i> Everyone should play one weird arthouse indie game a year and this is my recommendation. Play in Russian with subtitles for extra immersion. I don't know if I "liked" this (it's weird and random and mostly a walking sim with some puzzles) but I'm glad someone out there is making games about Russian nuns questioning the nature of faith.</li>
<li><b>Botany Manor</b><br>
<i>Engaging puzzling.</i> Well-crafted puzzles with a cohesive theme, challenging enough to be so satisfying but not so challenging that I got lost and needed to turn to walkthroughs. Unlocking new pages in the herbarium and exploring newly unlocked parts of the manor is very satisfying.</li>
<li><b>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</b><br>
<i>The best Indiana Jones content since The Last Crusade.</i> I'm a hard sell on big budget AAA games these days. It's rare that they're engaging enough to warrant the 10+ hour investment when I could play 2-3 excellent indie games in that same time. I'm also not a die-hard Indiana Jones fan (though I liked the original trilogy of movies). So this wasn't a game that was on my radar, until I kept hearing great things about it from friends, coworkers, and podcasts. It nails the Indiana Jones vibe and humour. I enjoyed the emphasis on exploration, puzzle solving, and stealth over combat, and it's fun to explore exotic locales like the Vatican and Gizeh.</li> 
<li><b>Still Wakes the Deep</b><br>
<i>Scottish horror.</i> I'm not a huge fan of horror, but I tried a handful of horror games this year (Mouthwashing, Night Bus, and this one) and Still Wakes the Deep was my favourite. The Scottish oil rig setting is compelling and unique, it did a great job of building atmosphere and tension, and it told an emotional story with characters that I actually cared about. At 4 hours long, it moved along at a steady clip and didn't overstay its welcome (horror elements definitely lose their punch and become just another gameplay element after you've seen them half a dozen times). Props to the team for embracing the setting fully, from the colourful Scottish slang to the option to display Scottish Gaelic subtitles.</li>
