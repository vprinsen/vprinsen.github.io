<h1>2023 Game of the Year</h1>
<i>Posted: March 2024</i>
<br><br>
It's that time of the year again: Game of the Year season! 
<br><br>
Ok, I'm kind of late with my hot takes this year, but being laid off in February threw a lot of things off-kilter. I actually thought that being unemployed would mean _more_ time to catch up on my games backlog, but it really meant long hours on Discord commiserating with former co-workers, on the phone with the EI office and the bank, and on Zoom interviewing in a far less generous market than 2 years ago. (I'm happy to say that I signed an offer last week and will be employed again as of April.)
<br><br>
On to the games! Last year, I knew what my GOTY would be 15 minutes into playing it (Citizen Sleeper). This year, the choice was less obvious. There were a LOT of great games, but very few that I finished (I'm sorry BG3, I promise that I'll get back to you). It was tough narrowing down the list of candidates but, without further ado, my personal GOTY pick for 2023 is...<br>

This game has so much personality and heart. The gameplay is nothing revolutionary (mostly turn-based battles and QuickTime events) but the writing is top notch and the story is compelling and meaningful. The art and animation styles are fantastic too, and communicate a lot of the game's humour. I continually found myself wanting to go back to and find out what happened next, which is rare when my growing backlog usually pushes me to move on to a new game. I also found myself hungry and hunting down kottu roti on UberEats for the second time this year. (It's a good year when I get to play TWO games about cooking South Asian food - shout out to Venba [https://store.steampowered.com/app/1491670/Venba/], a short but sweet game about the immigrant experience and cooking Tamil food!) 
<br><br>
<br><br>
And a close runner-up: 
<a href=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1593030/Terra_Nil/><h2>:::   Terra Nil   :::</h2></a>
A pretty and relaxing sim-puzzle game. Not quite a city builder, more of a puzzler that asks you to manage limited resources and balance different biomes in a limited space. I really enjoyed this one and it's one of the few games of 2023 that I fully completed.
<br><br>
<br><br>
And because I played so many good games this year, here are some other quick recommendations:
<ul>
<li><b>Hi-Fi Rush</b>: I loved the aesthetics and sheer fun of this rhythm-action game. Another game that, like Thirsty Suitors, succeeds from leaning into an over-the-top style.</li>
<li><b>Sea of Stars</b>: Beautiful art meets retro RPG gameplay. I'm not particularly into JPRGs but I enjoyed this one more than I expected. The level of craft and polish that went into it is exceptional. If you're into old-school RPGs like Chrono Trigger, definitely take a look at this one.</li>
<li><b>Chants of Sennar</b>: A game about decoding languages? Yes please. If you're into adventure/puzzle games and/or linguistics, check this one out.</li>
<li><b>Dordogne</b>: Every year, there's at least one game that makes me cry. This is 2023's. Heartwarming game with beautiful watercolour-style art that'll make you miss your childhood and your grandmother.</li>
<li><b>Piczle Lines 2</b>: Into the Puzzleverse: I can't in good conscience leave this game off the list, because it likely has my most hours played of any 2023 game - I had it on my Switch and played a puzzle or two at bedtime for months until I'd unlocked everything. If you're looking for a Picross-esque puzzle game to kill some time, check this out.</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
<br><br>
Last but not least, I'll hand out a retrospective award (a.k.a. a pre-2023 game that I first played in 2023):<br>

A rare game that I had to uninstall because I kept staying up till 3am playing it. Big "just one more turn..." energy. I just bought the board game version and I'm hoping that one is less life-consuming.
