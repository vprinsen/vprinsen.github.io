<h1>2023 Game of the Year</h1>
<i>Posted: March 2024</i>
<br><br>
It's that time of the year again: Game of the Year season! 
<br><br>
Ok, I'm kind of late with my hot takes this year, but being laid off in February threw a lot of things off-kilter. I actually thought that being unemployed would mean _more_ time to catch up on my games backlog, but it really meant long hours on Discord commiserating with former co-workers, on the phone with the EI office and the bank, and on Zoom interviewing in a far less generous market than 2 years ago. (I'm happy to say that I signed an offer last week and will be employed again as of April.)
<br><br>
On to the games! Last year, I knew what my GOTY would be 15 minutes into playing it (Citizen Sleeper). This year, the choice was less obvious. There were a LOT of great games, but very few that I finished (I'm sorry BG3, I promise that I'll get back to you). It was tough narrowing down the list of candidates but, without further ado, my personal GOTY pick for 2023 is...<br>

This game has so much personality and heart. The gameplay is nothing revolutionary (mostly turn-based battles and QuickTime events) but the writing is top notch and the story is compelling and meaningful. The art and animation styles are fantastic too, and communicate a lot of the game's humour. I continually found myself wanting to go back to and find out what happened next, which is rare when my growing backlog usually pushes me to move on to a new game. I also found myself hungry and hunting down kottu roti on UberEats for the second time this year. (It's a good year when I get to play TWO games about cooking South Asian food - shout out to Venba [https://store.steampowered.com/app/1491670/Venba/], a short but sweet game about the immigrant experience and cooking Tamil food!) 
<br><br>
<br><br>
And a close runner-up: 
<a href=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1593030/Terra_Nil/><h2>:::   Terra Nil   :::</h2></a>
A pretty and relaxing sim-puzzle game. Not quite a city builder, more of a puzzler that asks you to manage limited resources and balance different biomes in a limited space. I really enjoyed this one and it's one of the few games of 2023 that I fully completed.
<br><br>
<br><br>
And because I played so many good games this year, here are some other quick recommendations:
<ul>
<li><b>Hi-Fi Rush</b>: I loved the aesthetics and sheer fun of this rhythm-action game. Another game that, like Thirsty Suitors, succeeds from leaning into an over-the-top style.</li>
<li><b>Sea of Stars</b>: Beautiful art meets retro RPG gameplay. I'm not particularly into JPRGs but I enjoyed this one more than I expected. The level of craft and polish that went into it is exceptional. If you're into old-school RPGs like Chrono Trigger, definitely take a look at this one.</li>
<li><b>Chants of Sennar</b>: A game about decoding languages? Yes please. If you're into adventure/puzzle games and/or linguistics, check this one out.</li>
<li><b>Dordogne</b>: Every year, there's at least one game that makes me cry. This is 2023's. Heartwarming game with beautiful watercolour-style art that'll make you miss your childhood and your grandmother.</li>
<li><b>Piczle Lines 2</b>: Into the Puzzleverse: I can't in good conscience leave this game off the list, because it likely has my most hours played of any 2023 game - I had it on my Switch and played a puzzle or two at bedtime for months until I'd unlocked everything. If you're looking for a Picross-esque puzzle game to kill some time, check this out.</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
<br><br>
Last but not least, I'll hand out a retrospective award (a.k.a. a pre-2023 game that I first played in 2023):<br>

A rare game that I had to uninstall because I kept staying up till 3am playing it. Big "just one more turn..." energy. I just bought the board game version and I'm hoping that one is less life-consuming.

<u>2023 releases:</u>
<ul>
<li>Hi-Fi Rush
:: love the aesthetics and sheer fun of this game, but the levels and boss fights are repetitive. Best if not binged, even though it feels very bingeable. </li> 
<li>Luck be a Landlord
:: cool concept but not much depth, got a refund after 30 minutes </li>
<li>A Space for the Unbound 
:: supposedly interesting for its sense of place (rural Indonesia) but I couldn't get past how slow it is (lots of running back and forth, double-tap to run) and the awkward dialogue </li> 
<li>WW2 Rebuilder (demo)</li>
<li>Pizza Tower</li>
<li>Dredge
:: loved the atmosphere but the mechanics got very grindy. By the second village/island, I found myself spending most of my time sailing around the same places looking for treasure/fish, getting attacked, and having to spend 75% of my fishing income on repairs.</li>
<li>The Murder of Sonic the Hedgehog</li>
<li>Terra Nil
:: relaxing, pretty sim-puzzle game. Not quite a city builder, more puzzle-y with its need to manage limited resources and balance different biomes in a limited space.</li>  
<li>Advance Wars 1+2: Reboot Camp</li>
<li>Baldur's Gate 3</li>
<li>Venba
:: short but sweet game about the immigrant experience and cooking Tamil food (I'm hungry‚Ä¶)</li>
<li>Mis√©ricorde vol 1 üëé 
:: literally a visual novel, no choices, no gameplay - you're reading a book but you need to click to see every sentence. Also not a fan of the writing's contemporary voice (given that the story is set in the 1400s) and anachronistic artwork.</li>
<li>Assassin's Creed Mirage</li>
<li>The Pale Beyond (demo)</li>
<li>Mortal Kombat 1</li>
<li>Piczle Lines 2: Into the Puzzleverse</li>
<li>Diablo 4
:: A fun clicker that still doesn't measure up to Diablo 2. The story has its interesting moments (though it sometimes veers too much into ‚Äúdark for the sake of dark‚Äù), but there's so much side content that it feels sparse and hard to follow the main thread. The environments are also boring: I'm halfway in and they all feel very same-y: muddy greys and snow and grimdark brown, nothing like the sharp contrast between the different biomes in Diablo 2's 4 acts. The classes, too, feel very indistinct - the necro, at least, has so many skills that you can make it into anything. I feel no desire to play again with a different class, just feels like it would be more of the same. What's the difference between a non-summoner necro and a sorcery besides VFX colour? Perhaps most disappointingly, Blizzard is moving further towards making Diablo an MMO - there are other players running around (that I've never had reason to interact with), world events (unrelated to the story beyond ‚Äúhey, more demons! Kill them!‚Äù), and of course battle passes and real-world currency purchases. I'll keep playing because it has that addictive, simplistic loop of ‚Äúclick enemy -> something go boom -> loot explosion‚Äù that's appealing when's I've had a long day and don't want to think too hard, but it's far from a GOTY.</li>
<li>Chants of Sennar</li>
<li>Season Demo
:: I like the scrapbooking mechanic, but the narrative seems a little‚Ä¶ pretentious/try hard. (Dordogne does it better.)</li>
<li>Thirsty Suitors 
:: what is it with all the games this year making me hungry for South Asian food? ü§î I found this game really charming. The gameplay is mostly turn-based battles and QuickTime events, and the skateboarding controls are janky (luckily those segments are optional), but the game has so much heart. The writing is top notch and the story is compelling and meaningful. The art and animation style also suits it well, and communicates a lot of humour. I really enjoyed it and found myself wanting to go back and play to find out what happened next.</li>
<li>Dordogne
:: I'm not crying, you're crying. Heartwarming game with beautiful art, that'll make you miss your childhood and your grandmother.</li> 
<li>Urbo
:: Me midway into my first game: ‚ÄúThat's it? Maybe I'll return this‚Ä¶‚Äù
Me after my second game: ‚ÄúOh no.‚Äù
(Me after 6 games: ‚Äúok, that was fun. Next.‚Äù)</li>
<li>Jusant</li>
<li>Against the Storm</li>
<li>Jedi Survivor</li>
<li>Sea of Stars
:: beautiful art, classic/retro RPG styling and gameplay. I'm not particularly into this style of game but I got surprisingly into this one. The level of craft and polish that went into it is exceptional, though the gameplay itself gets repetitive after a while.</li> 
<li>Cobalt Core</li>
